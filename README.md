# Course Cloud
This is a final project for CS89 at Dartmouth College. We are using IBM's Watson to create an app that recommends classes to students based on past reviews.

## Run
- `yarn add expo-cli` (if you don't already have the expo cli)
- clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:erafkin/coursecloud.git`
- `yarn install`
- `expo start`
- once prompted, press `i` for an iOS simulator

## Stack
We used IBM Watson Assistant and Sentiment Analysis.
Data collected from [Layup List](https://www.layuplist.com/) as well as course reviews that can be accessed on (Banner/Darthub)[https://darthub.dartmouth.edu/].
App was built in React Native with Expo.
